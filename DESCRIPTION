Description: Provides general purpose tools for helping users to implement Bayesian
             models using R functions. Currently, Hit-and-Run Metropolis-within-Gibbs,
             Hit-and-Run Metropolis, and Steepest Hit-and-Run Metropolis are the MCMC
             algorithms implemented. Other MCMC algorithms will be implemented in the future.
