Description: Provides general purpose tools for helping users to implement Bayesian
             models using R functions. Currently, Metropolis-within-Gibbs, Random-walk
             Metropolis, Barker Proposal Metropolis, and Oblique Hyperrectangle
             Slice Sampler are the MCMC algorithms implemented. Other MCMC algorithms may be
             implemented in the future.
