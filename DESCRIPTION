Description: Provides general purpose tools for helping users to implement Bayesian
             models using R functions. Currently, Metropolis-within-Gibbs, Random-walk
             Metropolis, Barker Proposal Metropolis, and Oblique Hyperrectangle
             Slice Sampler are the MCMC algorithms implemented. Other MCMC algorithms may be
             implemented in the future. We also included an implementation of Laplace Approximation
             with Sampling-Importance Resampling.
